Provides an alternative category widget featuring fine grained control for use with the Shopp plugin.

== Description ==

This plugin works with and depends upon the Shopp e-commerce plugin for WordPress. It is designed to integrate with the 1.2.x branch of Shopp and has been successfully tested with Shopp 1.2.1.

Enough of that, what does it do?

* Shopp already ships with a widget that can be used to display product categories. This is an alternative to that widget.
* Select only those categories that you wish to include, ignore the rest.
* Easy to use: simply check the boxes for the relevant categories, choose the display mode (dropdown, regular list etc) and you're done.
* A convenient way to build category-based store menus in the sidebar!

== Installation ==

As with most WordPress plugins you should quite simply upload to the plugin directory, unzip and activate!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use CSS to style the currently active menu item? =

Not yet, this will be added in a future version.

= Does it work with Shopp 1.1.9 or earlier? =

No it does not.

= Can it display the list of categories as a dropdown menu? =

Of course! It can be a regular unordered list _or_ a dropdown (select element) and in either case it can render in either hierarchical or flat mode.

== Changelog ==

= 0.5.4 =
* Completely refactored for Shopp 1.2.x
* Improved rendering of hierarchies including a strategy to deal with orphaned sub-categories

== Upgrade Notice ==

* Ensure that the version you intend to update to is compatible with your installed version of Shopp
* Make a complete back-up of your site _before_ you upgrade
* Note down the category selections you have used in case they are lost
* Go ahead and update!

== Screenshots ==

Screenshots will be added in the very near future!
